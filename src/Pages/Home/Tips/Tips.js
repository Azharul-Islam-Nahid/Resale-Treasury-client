            <li className='mt-5'><strong>Save money:</strong>  In general, used items cost less than brand new items.</li>
            <li className='mt-5'><strong>Make better use of resources:</strong>  Every time you purchase new items, it's good to remember that a ton of resources were used to get that final product. By opting for items that other consumers have used before, you can extend their useful life and reduce resource consumption.</li>
            <li className='mt-5'><strong>Reduce pollution and waste:</strong>   Second-hand products don't usually come packaged with unnecessary plastic or cardboard. What's more, giving items a second chance means they don't have to be thrown awayâ€”reducing your waste overall. </li>
            <li className='mt-5'><strong>Find unique items: </strong>   Another big perk of buying second-hand is the chance to uncover one-of-a-kind treasures. Maybe it's an item that's no longer in production, a vintage classic, a hand-made textile, or a product that hails from another country. Why not try standing out from the crowd for a change? </li>
